        <h2>The Lore of DARK CITY</h2>
        <p>DARK CITY is a completely different Roleplay experience from a normal basic roleplay Cities of now a day, a wide variety of activities and lots of ways to live as a character. Be the good guy or the bad guy, but make sure you leave your mark on the board.</p>
        <h3>DCPD</h3>
        <p>Dark City is proud of its Police department, they have hierarchy than citizens & gangs. Every citizen should respect and follow their lead, disrespecting or mocking PD may cause serious consequences. Powerful and responsible PD are the law enforcement team of the crime filled Dark City. Taking hostage of an on-duty officer is considered as FRP.</p>
        <h3>DCMD</h3>
        <p>The most important job in the city is of the Medical Department, let it be War or peace, Medics are always on the run, from accidents to intentional Knockouts, the DCMD has got your back. Taking hostage of an on-duty officer is considered as FRP.</p>
        <h3>DCPC</h3>
        <p>Not usual in most of the cities but the Dark City citizens and Government authorities run under the strict protocol mentioned in the DARK CITY PENAL CODE, the Penal code for every Citizen to be followed.</p>
        <h3>DCBC</h3>
        <p>With crime comes confusions, even if 100s of convicts are let free not a single innocent is to be punished, in there comes the Bar Council of Dark City. With proper enrolment and interviews, your visions to become a lawyer is not far away.</p>
        <h3>Families of Dark City</h3>
        <p>No city is complete without a family. Families have activities that they’re never even heard of or maybe imagined of, after the enrolment from the family protocol at the DCPD, every family has leader boards to put their names on, from business wars to arial warfare, we have it all in Dark City.</p>
        <h3>Syndicate</h3>
        <p>The days of Dark city are peaceful and enjoyable, jobs, hangouts, adventure, but behind what you see in the daylight, there is a hand of darkness controlling everything, the whole economy of the city are in their hands. They are known as the syndicate, they are the origin of illegals. Guns, Ammos, Drugs, and even war vehicles can be found in their inventory, but the Legal System are not capable of reaching them, only because the Chief is the one who runs the city. Citizens & Gangs should show respect & fear towards them. Their words are final.</p>
        <h3>Admins of Dark City</h3>
        <p>Let it be day or night, you are not alone in this city, need a help? Just call for the Admins, from anything to everything they could help you through, the ones with abilities that no citizen is capable of.</p>
        <h3>Vehicular Warfare</h3>
        <p>Dark city introduces a wide variety of vehicular warfare for the underworlds of the city, without a bit of fire arms and fun, what’s family for? conquer land, water and air to put your family name on the leader boards.</p>
        <h3>HUBs</h3>
        <p>If you thought that’s all, it’s not over yet, the inflow of illegals is through specific hubs in the city, and those hubs cannot be taken through agreement, you need a hub? You fight for it. You lose, they get the hub and the respect, every seller sells to the hub and every buyer buys from the hub, it’s that simple folk.</p>
        <h3>Outro</h3>
        <p>For the final touch, the City is a playground of endless possibilities, from night clubs, pink slip races and the PD, the Dark City is simply an entirely different experience.</p>

        <h2>Roleplay Rules</h2>
        <h3>IMPORTANT RULES</h3>
        <p>If you think the opposing player is intentionally trying to provoke you. You must record your POV and do not provoke them back to create a situation. In extreme case situations and with a solid RP reason, if you have to take an officer as a hostage, make sure there are at least 8 other officers on duty. During any situation, if you aim at a police officer or give a warning fire to the police officer, they can shoot you down directly without any prior warning. If you want to start a shooting scenario but the other party isn't aware, you'll have to give him a chance by suppressing fire and giving them time to react to the shootout. Suppressing fire does not mean firing one bullet into the sky and the other into the head. You must give time to clear the situation or count till 30 before killing them. NOTE : If a family/gang declares open war on another team/gang, you do not need to give warning fire.</p>
        <p>You should not use the vale service to retrieve your vehicle during an active situation. You cannot kidnap or take a fight with a person for silly reasons like unknowingly pitting your vehicle, etc.</p>
        <p>No one is allowed to use voice chat or /me,/say,etc while dead; if this is reported, it will be considered a fail RP. You can use ooc chat only for informing ems services or any moderators if you are lacking ems services. [if seen this misusing , immediate action will be taken without warning] No Command Found - Say ILLEGAL RULES</p>
        <h3>PD vs Citizen Rules</h3>
        <p><strong>Firing Towards PD (Safe Zone)</strong><br>
        Firing towards the PD or Safe Zone is considered Fail Roleplay (FRP).</p>
        <p><strong>Search and Suspicion</strong><br>
        Police have the right to search both you and your vehicle if they suspect you or your vehicle is involved in criminal activity. It is your responsibility to prove your innocence.</p>
        <p><strong>Arrest with Arrest Warrant</strong><br>
        PD has the right to arrest a player once a government-issued arrest warrant is in place, regardless of location (Safe Zone, Gang House, City Limits).</p>
        <p><strong>Involvement in Robbery or Shooting</strong><br>
        If a player is not part of an ongoing robbery or shooting situation, they should not intervene. Interfering in these situations will be considered FRP.</p>
        <p><strong>Illegal Weapon Possession</strong><br>
